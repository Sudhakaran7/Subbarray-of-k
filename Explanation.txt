Given a list of numbers, and a Number K, you have to form subarrays which has excatly k different integers,
for example, (1,2,1,3,4), K = 3 Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers: [1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].

Input description:
two integers S K , S denotes the size of the array and K denotes the different integers,in next line the array of elements
(1<S,K<1000)

Output Description:
The number of subarray formed with exactly K different integres.
